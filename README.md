## General info
This project was undertaken so as to build a grid-based framework (similar to bootstrap) that includes some basic functionality necessary to build a website. The project is relatively open-ended to give us a chance to exercise our creativity and problem-solving skills. This customed framework was also used to clone a couple of sites in order to test its responsive specificities. It is created and built by <a href="https://github.com/adaorachi">MaryAnn Chukwuka</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Jaykowski">Judah Maina</a>.

## Setup & Live Preview
This project is built with the basic web page structures and styling. It is pretty simple to setup. All you have to do is to clone the project into your local repository.<br>
This is a preview of one of sites cloned with this framework - <a href="https://raw.githack.com/JayKowski/sass-framework/framework/index.html">Yogalax clone page </a>

## Inspiration
The inspiration to our cloned site is gotten from the <a href="https://colorlib.com/preview/theme/yogalax/"> Yogalax (A yoga website)</a>. The website uses a popular css grid framework (Bootstrap), hence our choice to clone it.
